# An overview of `Roots`

The `Roots` package contains simple routines for finding zeros of
continuous scalar functions of a single real variable.  A zero of $f$
is a value $c$ where $f(c) = 0$.  The basic interface is through the
function `find_zero`, which through multiple dispatch can handle many different cases.

The [NonlinearSolve](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/NonlinearSolve.jl) package provides an alternative.

In the following, we will use `Plots` for plotting and `ForwardDiff`
to take derivatives.

```jldoctest roots
julia> using Roots

julia> using Plots, ForwardDiff


```

## Bracketing

For a function $f$ (univariate, real-valued) a *bracket* is a pair $ a < b $
for which $f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0$. That is the function values have
different signs at $a$ and $b$. If
$f$ is a continuous function this ensures
([Bolzano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem))
there will be a zero in the interval $[a,b]$.  If $f$ is not
continuous, then there must be a point $c$ in $[a,b]$ where the function
"jumps" over $0$.

Such values can be found, up to floating point
roundoff. That is, given `f(a) * f(b) < 0`, a value `c` with `a < c < b` can be
found where either `f(c) == 0.0` or  `f(prevfloat(c)) * f(c) < 0` or
`f(c) * f(nextfloat(c)) < 0`.

To illustrate, consider the function $f(x) = \cos(x) - x$. From the
graph we see readily that $[0,1]$ is a bracket (which we emphasize
with an overlay):

```@example roots
using Plots, Roots
f(x) = cos(x) - x
plot(f, -2, 2)
plot!([0,1], [0,0], linewidth=2)
savefig("plot-f-1.svg"); nothing #hide
```

![](plot-f-1.svg)

The `Roots` package includes the bisection algorithm through
`find_zero`. We use a structure for which `extrema` returns `(a,b)`
with `a < b`, such as a vector or tuple, to specify the initial
condition and `Bisection()` to specify the algorithm:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = cos(x) - x
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = find_zero(f, (0, 1), Bisection())    # alternatively fzero(f, [0, 1])
0.7390851332151607

julia> x, f(x)
(0.7390851332151607, 0.0)
```

For this function we see that `f(x)` is `0.0`.

----

Next consider $f(x) = \sin(x)$. A known zero is $\pi$. Trigonometry
tells us that $[\pi/2, 3\pi/2]$ will be a bracket. In this call `Bisection()`
is not specified, as it will be the default when the initial value is
specified as a pair of numbers:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = sin(x)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = find_zero(f, (pi/2, 3pi/2))
3.1415926535897936

julia> x, f(x)
(3.1415926535897936, -3.216245299353273e-16)

```

This value of `x` does not exactly produce a zero, however, it is as close as can be:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(prevfloat(x)) * f(x) < 0.0 || f(x) * f(nextfloat(x)) < 0.0
true

```

That is, at `x` the function is changing sign.

From a mathematical perspective, a zero is guaranteed for a
*continuous* function. However, the computer algorithm doesn't assume
continuity, it just looks for changes of sign. As such, the algorithm
will  identify discontinuities, not just zeros. For example:

```jldoctest roots
julia> find_zero(x -> 1/x, (-1, 1))
0.0

```


The endpoints and function values can even be infinite:

```jldoctest roots
julia> find_zero(x -> Inf*sign(x), (-Inf, Inf))  # Float64 only
0.0

```


The basic algorithm used for bracketing when the values are simple
floating point values is a modification of the bisection method. For big float values, an
algorithm due to Alefeld, Potra, and Shi is used.

```jldoctest roots
julia> find_zero(sin, (big(3), big(4)))    # uses a different algorithm than for (3,4)
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286198


```

By default, bisection will converge to machine tolerance. This may
provide more accuracy than desired. A tolerance may be specified to
terminate early, thereby utilizing fewer resources. For example, this
uses 19 steps to reach accuracy to $10^{-6}$ (without specifying `xatol` it uses
51 steps):

```jldoctest roots
julia> rt = find_zero(sin, (3.0, 4.0), xatol=1e-6)
3.141592502593994

julia> rt - pi
-1.5099579897537296e-7

```


## Non-bracketing problems

Bracketing methods have guaranteed convergence, but in general require
many more function calls than are needed to produce an answer.  If a
good initial guess is known, then the `find_zero` function provides an
interface to some different iterative algorithms that are more
efficient. Unlike bracketing methods, these algorithms may not
converge to the desired root if the initial guess is not well chosen.

The default algorithm is modeled after an algorithm used for
[HP-34 calculators](http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1979-12.pdf). This
algorithm is designed to be more forgiving of the quality of the
initial guess at the cost of possibly performing many more steps than
other algorithms, as if the algorithm encounters a bracket, bisection
will be used.

For example, the answer to our initial problem is visibly seen from a
graph to be near 1. Given this,
the zero is found through:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = cos(x) - x
f (generic function with 1 method)


julia> x = find_zero(f , 1)
0.7390851332151607

julia> x, f(x)
(0.7390851332151607, 0.0)

```

For the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5$, an initial guess of 2 seems reasonable:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = find_zero(f, 2)
2.0945514815423265

julia> x, f(x), sign(f(prevfloat(x)) * f(nextfloat(x)))
(2.0945514815423265, -8.881784197001252e-16, -1.0)

```

For even more precision, `BigFloat` numbers can be used

```jldoctest roots
julia> x = find_zero(sin, big(3))
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286198

julia> x, sin(x), x - pi
(3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286198, 1.096917440979352076742130626395698021050758236508687951179005716992142688513354e-77, 0.0)

```

### Higher order methods

The default call to `fzero` uses a first order method and then
possibly bracketing, which involves potentially many more function
calls. There may be times where a more efficient algorithm is
sought.  For such, a higher-order method might be better suited. There
are algorithms `Order1` (secant method), `Order2`
([Steffensen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffensen's_method)),
`Order5`, `Order8`, and `Order16`. The order 1 or 2 methods are
generally quite efficient. The even higher order ones are potentially
useful when more precision is used. These algorithms are accessed by
specifying the method after the initial starting point:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = 2x - exp(-x)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = find_zero(f, 1, Order1())      # also fzero(f, 1, order=1)
0.3517337112491958

julia> x, f(x)
(0.3517337112491958, -1.1102230246251565e-16)

```

The above makes $8$ function calls, to the $57$ made with `Order0`.

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = (x + 3) * (x - 1)^2
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = find_zero(f, -2, Order2())
-3.0

julia> x, f(x)
(-3.0, 0.0)

```


```jldoctest roots
julia> x = find_zero(f, 2, Order8())
1.0000000027152591

julia> x, f(x)
(1.0000000027152591, 2.949052856287529e-17)

```

The latter shows that zeros need not be simple zeros  to be found.
A simple zero, $c$,has $f(x) = (x-c) \cdot g(x)$ where $g(c) \neq 0$.
Generally speaking, non-simple zeros are
expected to take many more function calls, as the methods are no
longer super-linear. This is the case here, where `Order2` uses $55$
function calls, `Order8` uses $41$, and `Order0` takes, a comparable, $42$.)

To investigate an algorithm and its convergence, the argument
`verbose=true` may be specified.


For some functions, adjusting the default tolerances may be necessary
to achieve convergence. The tolerances include `atol` and `rtol`, which are
used to check if $f(x_n) \approx 0$;
`xatol` and `xrtol`, to check if $x_n \approx x_{n-1}$; and `maxevals` and `maxfnevals` to limit the
number of steps in the algorithm or function calls.



## Classical methods

The package provides some classical methods for root finding:
`Roots.newton`, `Roots.halley`, and `Roots.secant_method`. (Currently
these are not exported, so must be prefixed with the package name to
be used.) We can see how each works on a problem studied by Newton
himself. Newton's method uses the function and its derivative:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> fp(x) = 3x^2 - 2
fp (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = Roots.newton(f, fp, 2)
2.0945514815423265

julia> x, f(x)
(2.0945514815423265, -8.881784197001252e-16)

```

To see the algorithm in progress, the argument `verbose=true` may be
specified.

Alternatively, `Roots.Newton()` can be specified as the method for `find_zero`. The
functions are specified using a tuple:

```jldoctest roots
julia> find_zero((f,fp), 2, Roots.Newton())
2.0945514815423265

```

The secant method typically needs two starting points, though a second
one is computed if only one is give. Here we start with 2 and 3,
specified through a tuple:

```jldoctest roots
julia> x = Roots.secant_method(f, (2,3))
2.094551481542327

julia> x, f(x)
(2.094551481542327, 3.552713678800501e-15)

```

Starting with a single point is also supported:

```jldoctest roots
julia> Roots.secant_method(f, 2)
2.0945514815423265

```

(This is like `Order1()`, or `Roots.Secant()`, but the implementation is
faster, as the framework is bypassed, and fewer checks on convergence
are used. This method can be used when speed is very important.)

Halley's method has cubic convergence, as compared to Newton's
quadratic convergence. It uses the second derivative as well:

```jldoctest roots
julia> fpp(x) = 6x
fpp (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = Roots.halley(f, fp, fpp, 2)
2.0945514815423265

julia> x, f(x), sign(f(prevfloat(x)) * f(nextfloat(x)))
(2.0945514815423265, -8.881784197001252e-16, -1.0)

```

(Halley's method takes 3 steps, Newton's 4, but Newton's uses 5
function calls to Halley's 10.)

For many functions, their derivatives can be computed automatically. The
`ForwardDiff` package provides a means. Here we define an operator `D`
to compute a derivative:

```jldoctest roots
julia> using ForwardDiff

julia> function D(f, n::Int=1)
           n <= 0 && return f
           n == 1 && return x -> ForwardDiff.derivative(f,float(x))
           D(D(f,1),n-1)
       end
D (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> dfᵏs(f,k) = ntuple(i->D(f,i-1), Val(k+1)) # (f, f′, f′′, …)
dfᵏs (generic function with 1 method)
```


```jldoctest roots
julia> Roots.newton(f, D(f), 2)
2.0945514815423265

```

Or, for Halley's method:

```jldoctest roots
julia> Roots.halley(f, D(f), D(f,2), 2)
2.0945514815423265

```

The familiy of solvers implemented in `Roots.LithBoonkkampIJzerman(S,D)` where `S` is the number of prior points used to generate the next, and `D` is the number of derivatives used, has both the secant method (`S=2, D=0`) and Newton's method (`S=1, D=1`) as members, but also provides others. By adding more memory or adding more derivatives the convergence rate increases, at the expense of more complicated expressions or more function calls per step.

```
julia> find_zero(dfᵏs(f, 0), 2, Roots.LithBoonkkampIJzerman(3,0)) # like secant
2.0945514815423265

julia> find_zero(dfᵏs(f, 1), 2, Roots.LithBoonkkampIJzerman(2,1)) # like Newton
2.0945514815423265

julia> find_zero(dfᵏs(f, 2), 2, Roots.LithBoonkkampIJzerman(2,2)) # like Halley
2.0945514815423265
```

## The problem-algorithm-solve interface

The problem-algorithm-solve interface is a pattern popularized in `Julia` by the `DifferentialEquations.jl` suite of packages. The pattern consists of setting up a *problem* then *solving* the problem by specifying an *algorithm*. This is very similar to what is specified in the `find_zero(f, x0, M)` interface where `f` and `x0` specify the problem, `M` the algorithm, and `find_zero` calls the solver.

To break this up into steps, `Roots` has methods `ZeroProblem` and `init`, `solve`, and `solve!` from the `CommonSolve.jl` package.

Consider solving ``\sin(x) = 0`` using the `Secant` method starting with the interval ``[3,4]``.

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = sin(x)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x0 = (3, 4)
(3, 4)

julia> M = Roots.Secant()
Roots.Secant()

julia> Z = ZeroProblem(f, x0)
ZeroProblem{typeof(f), Tuple{Int64, Int64}}(f, (3, 4))

julia> solve(Z, M)
3.141592653589793
```

Changing the method is easy:

```jldoctest roots
julia> solve(Z, Roots.Order2())
3.1415926535897944
```

The `solve` interface works with parameterized functions, as well:

```jldoctest roots
julia> g(x,p) = cos(x) - x/p
g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> Z = ZeroProblem(g, (0.0, pi/2))
ZeroProblem{typeof(g), Tuple{Float64, Float64}}(g, (0.0, 1.5707963267948966))

julia> solve(Z, Roots.Secant(), 2) # p=2
1.0298665293222589

julia> solve(Z, Bisection(), 3)
1.1701209500026262
```

Behind the scenes an iterator is created, then iterated to convergence. This iterator can be exposed programatically, which might be of use if details of the algorithm are desired:

```jldoctest roots
julia> Z, M = ZeroProblem(sin, (3, 4)), Roots.Secant();

julia> prob = init(Z, M);  # A ZeroProblemIterator instance

julia> solve!(prob)
3.141592653589793

julia> prob.state.fnevals
7
```

Or more explicitly:

```jldoctest roots
julia> prob = init(Z, M);

julia> steps = 0
0

julia> for _ in prob; steps += 1; end

julia> steps, last(prob)
(5, 3.141592653589793)
```




## Finding critical points

The `D` function, defined above, makes it straightforward to find critical points
(typically where the derivative is $0$ but also where it is undefined). For example, the critical
point of the function $f(x) = 1/x^2 + x^3, x > 0$ near $1.0$ is where
the derivative is $0$ and can be found through:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = 1/x^2 + x^3
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> find_zero(D(f), 1)
0.9221079114817278

```

For more complicated expressions, `D` will not work, and other means
of finding a derivative can be employed. In
this example, we have a function that models the flight
of an arrow on a windy day:

```jldoctest roots
julia> function flight(x, theta)
         k = 1/2
         a = 200*cosd(theta)
         b = 32/k
         tand(theta)*x + (b/a)*x - b*log(a/(a-x))
       end
flight (generic function with 1 method)

```



The total distance flown is when `flight(x) == 0.0` for some `x > 0`:
This can be solved for different `theta` with `find_zero`. In the
following, we note that `log(a/(a-x))` will have an asymptote at `a`,
so we start our search at `a-5`:

```jldoctest roots
julia> function howfar(theta)
         a = 200*cosd(theta)
         find_zero(x -> flight(x, theta), a-5)
        end
howfar (generic function with 1 method)

```

To visualize the trajectory if shot at 45 degrees, we have:


```@example roots
flight(x, theta) = (k = 1/2;a = 200*cosd(theta);b = 32/k;tand(theta)*x + (b/a)*x - b*log(a/(a-x))); nothing
howfar(theta) = (a = 200*cosd(theta);find_zero(x -> flight(x, theta), a-5)); nothing
howfarp(theta,h=1e-5) = (howfar(theta+h) - howfar(theta-h)) / (2h); nothing
tstar = find_zero(howfarp, 45); nothing  # hide

theta = 45
plot(x -> flight(x,  theta), 0, howfar(theta))
savefig("flight.svg"); nothing # hide
```

![](flight.svg)


To maximize the range we solve for the lone critical point of `howfar`
within reasonable starting points. In this example, the derivative can not be taken automatically with
`D`. So,  here we use a central-difference approximation and start the
search at 45 degrees--the angle which maximizes the trajectory on a
non-windy day:

```jldoctest roots
julia> h = 1e-5
1.0e-5

julia> howfarp(theta) = (howfar(theta+h) - howfar(theta-h)) / (2h)
howfarp (generic function with 1 method)

julia> tstar = find_zero(howfarp, 45)
26.262308916287818

```

This graph shows the differences in the trajectories:

```@example roots
plot(x -> flight(x, 45), 0, howfar(45))
plot!(x -> flight(x, tstar), 0, howfar(tstar))
savefig("flight-2.svg"); nothing #hide
```

![](flight-2.svg)


## ForwardDiff

We have seen that `ForwardDiff` can be used to specify functions to pass to `find_zero`. This example shows what is necessary to use `ForwardDiff` to differentiate a problem which internally calls `find_zero`. It comes from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68485811/julia-roots-find-zero-with-forwarddiff-dual-type). The main issue is technical. When `find_zero` sets up a problem, it creates a state which specifies types for the ``x`` and ``f(x)`` values. These types are found from the initial `x0` values passed to `find_zero(f, x0, M)`, *after* calling `float`, and the corresponding `f(x)` values. In the following, it is necessary to ensure the type for the `x0` value is the underlying type for forward differentiation by `ForwardDiff`. This is the working solution:

```julia
julia> using Distributions, Roots, StatsFuns, ForwardDiff

julia> function test_fun(θ::AbstractVector{T}) where T
           μ,σ,p = θ;
           x0 = zero(eltype(θ)) # <<<--- not 0.0, which will error
           z_star = find_zero(z -> logistic(z) - p, x0)
           return pdf(Normal(μ,σ), z_star)
       end
test_fun (generic function with 1 method)

julia> test_fun([0.0,1.0,0.75])
0.2181847684199842

julia> ForwardDiff.gradient(test_fun,[0.0,1.0,0.75])
3-element Vector{Float64}:
  0.23970046778640028
  0.045153111089649756
 -1.2784024948607997
```




## Potential issues

The higher-order methods are basically various derivative-free
versions of Newton's method (which has update step $x - f(x)/f'(x)$). For
example, Steffensen's method (`Order2()`) essentially replaces $f'(x)$ with
$(f(x + f(x)) - f(x))/f(x)$. This is a forward-difference
approximation to the derivative with "$h$" being $f(x)$, which
presumably is close to $0$ already. The methods with higher order
combine this with different secant line approaches that minimize the
number of function calls. These higher-order methods can be
susceptible to some of the usual issues found with Newton's method:
poor initial guess, small first derivative, or large second derivative
near the zero.

When the first derivative is near $0$, the value of the next step can
be quite different, as the next step generally tracks the intersection point of
the tangent line. We see that starting at a $\pi/2$ causes this search
to be problematic:

```jldoctest roots
julia> try  find_zero(sin, pi/2, Order1()) catch err  "Convergence failed" end
"Convergence failed"

```

(Whereas, starting at `pi/2 + 0.3`--where the slope of the tangent
is sufficiently close to point towards $\pi$--will find convergence at $\pi$.)

For a classic example where a large second derivative is
the issue, we have $f(x) = x^{1/3}$:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = cbrt(x)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x = try  find_zero(f, 1, Order2())  catch err  "Convergence failed" end	# all of 2, 5, 8, and 16 fail or diverge towards infinity
"Convergence failed"

```

However, the default finds the root here, as a bracket is identified:

```jldoctest roots
julia> x = find_zero(f, 1)
0.0

julia> x,  f(x)
(0.0, 0.0)

```

Finally, for many functions, all of these methods need a good initial
guess. For example, the polynomial function $f(x) = x^5 - x - 1$ has
its one zero near $1.16$. If we start far from it, convergence may
happen, but it isn't guaranteed:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = x^5 - x - 1
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x0 = 0.1
0.1

julia> try find_zero(f, x0)  catch err  "Convergence failed" end
"Convergence failed"

```

Whereas,

```jldoctest roots
julia> try find_zero(f, x0, Order2())  catch err  "Convergence failed" end
"Convergence failed"


```

A graph shows the issue. We have overlayed 15 steps of Newton's
method, the other algorithms being somewhat similar:

```@example roots
using ForwardDiff
D(f) = x -> ForwardDiff.derivative(f,float(x))
xs = [0.1] # x0
n = 15
for i in 1:(n-1) push!(xs, xs[end] - f(xs[end])/D(f)(xs[end])) end
ys = [zeros(Float64,n)';map(f, xs)'][1:2n]
xs = xs[repeat(collect(1:n), inner=[2], outer=[1])]
plot(f, -1.25, 1.5, linewidth=3, legend=false)
plot!(zero, -1.25, 1.5, linewidth=3)
plot!(xs, ys)
savefig("newton-15.svg"); nothing #hide
```

![](newton-15.svg)

Though 15 steps are shown, only a few are discernible, as the function's relative maximum
causes a trap for this algorithm. Starting to the right of the
relative minimum--nearer the zero--would avoid this trap. The default
method employs a trick to bounce out of such traps, though it doesn't
always work.

###  Tolerances

Mathematically solving for a zero of a nonlinear function may be
impossible, so numeric methods are utilized. However, using floating
point numbers to approximate the real numbers leads to some nuances.


For example, consider the polynomial $f(x) = (3x-1)^5$ with one zero
at $1/3$ and its equivalent expression $f1(x) = -1 + 15\cdot x - 90\cdot
x^2 + 270\cdot x^3 - 405\cdot x^4 + 243\cdot x^5$. Mathematically
these are the same, however not so when evaluated in floating
point. Here we look at the 21 floating point numbers near $1/3$:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = (3x-1)^5
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f1(x) =  -1 + 15*x - 90*x^2 + 270*x^3 - 405*x^4 + 243*x^5
f1 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> ns = [1/3];

julia> u=1/3; for i in 1:10 (global  u=nextfloat(u);push!(ns, u)) end

julia> u=1/3; for i in 1:10 (global  u=prevfloat(u);push!(ns, u)) end

julia> sort!(ns);

julia> maximum(abs.(f.(ns) - f1.(ns)))
1.887379141862766e-15

```


We see the function values are close for each point, as the maximum difference
is like $10^{15}$. This is roughly as expected, where even one
addition may introduce a relative error as big as $2\cdot 10^{-16}$ and here
there are several such.

!!! note
    (These values are subject to the vagaries of floating point evaluation, so may differ depending on the underlying computer architecture.)

Generally this variation is not even a thought, as the differences are generally
negligible, but when we want to identify if a value is zero, these
small differences might matter. Here we look at the signs of the
function values for a run of the above:


```
julia> fs = sign.(f.(ns));

julia> f1s = sign.(f1.(ns));

julia> [ns.-1/3 fs f1s]
21×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 -5.55112e-16  -1.0  -1.0
 -4.996e-16    -1.0  -1.0
 -4.44089e-16  -1.0   1.0
 -3.88578e-16  -1.0   1.0
 -3.33067e-16  -1.0   1.0
 -2.77556e-16  -1.0   1.0
 -2.22045e-16  -1.0  -1.0
 -1.66533e-16  -1.0  -1.0
 -1.11022e-16  -1.0   1.0
 -5.55112e-17  -1.0   1.0
  0.0           0.0  -1.0
  5.55112e-17   0.0   1.0
  1.11022e-16   1.0   1.0
  1.66533e-16   1.0  -1.0
  2.22045e-16   1.0  -1.0
  2.77556e-16   1.0  -1.0
  3.33067e-16   1.0   1.0
  3.88578e-16   1.0   1.0
  4.44089e-16   1.0   1.0
  4.996e-16     1.0  -1.0
  5.55112e-16   1.0   0.0
```


Parsing this shows a few surprises. First, there are two zeros of
`f(x)` identified--not just one as expected mathematically--the
floating point value of `1/3` and the next largest floating point
number.

```
julia> findall(iszero, fs)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 11
 12
```



For `f1(x)` there is only one zero, but it isn't the floating
point value for `1/3` but rather 10 floating point numbers
away.


```
julia> findall(iszero, f1s)
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 21
```



Further, there are several sign changes of the function values for `f1s`:

```
julia> findall(!iszero,diff(sign.(f1s)))
9-element Vector{Int64}:
  2
  6
  8
 10
 11
 13
 16
 19
 20

```

There is no guarantee that a zero will be present, but for a
mathematical function that changes sign, there will be at least one
sign change.

With this in mind, an exact zero of `f` would be either where `iszero(f(x))` is true *or* where the function has a sign change (either `f(x)*f(prevfloat(x))<0` or `f(x)*f(nextfloat(x)) < 0`).

As mentioned, the default `Bisection()` method of `find_zero`
identifies such zeros for `f` provided an initial bracketing interval
is specified when `Float64` numbers are used.  However, if a
mathematical function does not cross the $x$ axis at a zero, then
there is no guarantee the floating point values will satisfy either of
these conditions.


Now consider the function `f(x) = exp(x)-x^4`. The value`x=8.613169456441398` is a zero in this sense, as there is a change of sign:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = exp(x) - x^4
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> F(x) = sign(f(x))
F (generic function with 1 method)

julia> x=8.613169456441398
8.613169456441398

julia> F(prevfloat(x)), F(x), F(nextfloat(x))
(-1.0, -1.0, 1.0)

```

However, the value of `f(x)` is not as small as one might initially
expect for a zero:

```
julia> f(x), abs(f(x)/eps(x))
(-2.7284841053187847e-12, 1536.0)

```

The value `x` is an approximation to the actual mathematical zero,
call it $x$. There is a difference between $f(x)$ (the mathematical answer) and `f(x)` (the floating point answer). Roughly speaking we expect `f(x)` to be about $f(x) + f'(x)\cdot \delta$, where $\delta$ is the difference between `x` and $x$. This will be on the scale of `abs(x) * eps()`, so all told we expect an answer to be in the range of $0$ plus or minus this value:

```jldoctest roots
julia> fp(x) = exp(x) - 4x^3 # the derivative
fp (generic function with 1 method)

julia> fp(x) * abs(x) * eps()
5.637565490466956e-12

```

which is about what we see.

Bisection can be a slower method than others. For floating point values, `Bisection()` takes no more than 64 steps, but other methods may be able to converge to a zero in 4-5 steps (assuming good starting values are specified).

When fewer function calls are desirable, then checking for an
*approximate* zero may be preferred over assessing if a sign change
occurs, as generally that will take two additional function calls per
step. Besides, a sign change isn't guaranteed for all zeros. An approximate zero would be one where $f(x) \approx 0$.

By the above, we see that we must consider an appropriate
tolerance. The first example shows differences in floating point
evaluations from the mathematical ones might introduce errors on the
scale of `eps` regardless of the size of `x`. As seen in the second
example, the difference between the floating point approximation to
the zero and the zero introduces a potential error *proportional* to
the size of `x`. So a tolerance might consider both types of
errors. An absolute tolerance is used as well as a relative tolerance,
so a check might look like:

```verbatim
abs(f(x)) < max(atol, abs(x) * rtol)
```

This is different from `Julia`'s `isapprox(f(x), 0.0)`, as that would use `abs(f(x))` as the multiplier, which renders a relative tolerance useless for this question.

One issue with relative tolerances is that for functions with
sublinear growth, extremely large values will be considered zeros.
Returning to an earlier example, we have a misidentified zero:

```jldoctest roots
julia> find_zero(cbrt, 1, Order8())
2.0998366730115564e23

```

For `Order8`, the algorithm rapidly marches off towards infinity so the relative
tolerance $\approx |x| \cdot \epsilon$ used to check if $f(x) \approx
0$ is large compared to the far-from zero $f(x)$.

Either the users must be educated about this possibility, or the
relative tolerance should be set to $0$. In that case, the absolute
tolerance must be relatively generous.  A conservative choice of
absolute tolerance might be `sqrt(eps())`, or about `1e-8`,
essentially the one made in SciPy.

This is not the choice made in `Roots`. The fact that bisection can
produce zeros as exact as possible, and the fact that the error in
function evaluation, $f'(x)|x|\epsilon$, is not typically on the scale
of `1e-8`, leads to a desire for more precision, if available.

In `Roots`, the faster algorithms use a check on both the size of
`f(xn)` and the size of the difference between the last two `xn` values. The check on `f(xn)`
is done with a tight tolerance, as is the check on $x_n \approx
x_{n-1}$. If the function values get close to zero, an
approximate zero is declared. Further, if the $x$ values get close to each other
*and* the function value is close to zero with a *relaxed* tolerance,
then an approximate zero is declared. In practice this seems to work
reasonably well. The relaxed tolerance uses the cube root of the
absolute and relative tolerances.







## Searching for all zeros in an interval

The methods described above are used to identify one of possibly
several zeros.  The `find_zeros` function searches the interval $(a,b)$
for all zeros of a function $f$. It is straightforward to use:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = exp(x) - x^4
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> a, b = -10, 10
(-10, 10)

julia> zs = find_zeros(f, a, b)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 -0.8155534188089606
  1.4296118247255556
  8.613169456441398

```

The search interval, $(a,b)$, is specified either through two
arguments or through a single argument using a structure, such as a
tuple or vector, where `extrema` returns two distinct values in
increasing order.  It is assumed that neither endpoint is a zero. Here
we see the result of the search graphically:

```@example roots
f(x) = exp(x) - x^4; nothing
a,b=-10,10; nothing
zs = find_zeros(f, a, b); nothing
plot(f, a, b)
scatter!(zs, f.(zs))
savefig("plot-f-2.svg"); nothing #hide
```

![](plot-f-2.svg)


We can identify points where the first and second derivative is
zero. We use `D` from above:


```@example roots
f(x) = cos(x) + cos(2x)
a, b = -10, 10
cps = find_zeros(D(f), a, b)
ips = find_zeros((D∘D)(f), a, b)
plot(f, a, b)
scatter!(cps, f.(cps))
scatter!(ips, f.(ips), markercolor = :yellow)
savefig("plot-f-3.svg"); nothing
```

![](plot-f-3.svg)


The `find_zeros` algorithm will use bisection when a bracket is
identified. This method will identify jumps, so areas where the
derivative changes sign (and not necessarily a zero of the derivative)
will typically be identified:

```@example roots
f(x) = abs(cbrt(x^2-1))
a, b = -5, 5
cps = find_zeros(D(f), a, b)
plot(f, a, b)
scatter!(cps, f.(cps))
savefig("plot-f-4.svg"); nothing
```

![](plot-f-4.svg)

In this example, the derivative has vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and
$x=-1$ so is not continuous there. The bisection method identifies the
zero crossing, not a zero.

----


The search for all zeros in an interval is confounded by a few things:

* too many zeros in the interval $(a,b)$
* nearby zeros ("nearby" depends on the size of $(a,b)$ as well should this be very wide)

The algorithm is adaptive, so that it can succeed when there are many
zeros, but it may be necessary to increase `no_pts` from the default
of 12, at the cost of possibly taking longer for the search.

Here the algorithm identifies all the zeros, despite there being several:

```@example roots
f(x) = cos(x)^2 + cos(x^2)
a, b = 0, 10
rts = find_zeros(f, a, b)
plot(f, a, b)
scatter!(rts, f.(rts))
savefig("plot-f-4a.svg"); nothing
```

![](plot-f-4a.svg)


For nearby zeros, the algorithm does pretty well, though it isn't
perfect.

Here we see for $f(x) = \sin(1/x)$--with infinitely many zeros around
$0$--it finds many:

```@example roots
f(x) = iszero(x) ? NaN : sin(1/x)  # avoid sin(Inf) error
rts = find_zeros(f, -1, 1)  # 88 zeros identified
plot(f, -1, 1)
scatter!(rts, f.(rts))
savefig("plot-f-5.svg"); nothing
```

![](plot-f-5.svg)

The function, $f(x) = (x-0.5)^3 \cdot (x-0.499)^3$, looks *too* much like
$g(x) = x^6$ to `find_zeros` for success, as the two zeros are very nearby:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) =  (x-0.5)^3 * (x-0.499)^3
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> find_zeros(f, 0, 1)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.5

```

The issue here isn't *just* that the algorithm can't identify zeros
within $0.001$ of each other, but that the high power makes many
nearby values approximately zero.

The algorithm will have success when the powers are smaller

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) =  (x-0.5)^2 * (x-0.499)^2
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> find_zeros(f, 0, 1)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.49899999999999994
 0.5

```

It can have success for closer pairs of zeros:

```jldoctest roots
julia> f(x) = (x-0.5) * (x - 0.49999)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> find_zeros(f, 0, 1)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.49999
 0.5

```

Combinations of large (even) multiplicity zeros or very nearby
zeros, can lead to misidentification.

### IntervalRootFinding

The [IntervalRootFinding](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalRootFinding.jl) package rigorously identifies isolating intervals for the zeros of a function. This example, from that package's README, is used to illustrate the differences:

```jldoctest interval_root_finding
julia> using IntervalArithmetic, IntervalRootFinding, Roots

julia> f(x) = sin(x) - 0.1*x^2 + 1
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> rts = roots(f, -10..10)
4-element Vector{Root{Interval{Float64}}}:
 Root([3.14959, 3.1496], :unique)
 Root([-4.42654, -4.42653], :unique)
 Root([-3.10682, -3.10681], :unique)
 Root([-1.08205, -1.08204], :unique)

julia> find_zeros(f, -10, 10)
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 -4.426534982071949
 -3.1068165552293254
 -1.0820421327607177
  3.1495967624505226
```

Using that in this case, the intervals are bracketing intervals for `f`, we can find the zeros from the `roots` ouput with the following:

```jldoctest interval_root_finding
julia> [find_zero(f, (interval(u).lo, interval(u).hi)) for u ∈ rts if u.status == :unique]
4-element Vector{Float64}:
  3.1495967624505226
 -4.426534982071949
 -3.1068165552293254
 -1.082042132760718
```
